# autophagosome_shapes

Code used in the mathematical model calculations to determine the stable membrane shapes in the paper.\
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500884v1 \
Figures 6 and 7 in the paper can be computed using this code.\
The elastic bending energy of the membrane can be used to determine the stable shape using the Euler-Lagrange method.

Since the code is written in Fortran, it should be executed on a machine with a Fortran compiler installed.
